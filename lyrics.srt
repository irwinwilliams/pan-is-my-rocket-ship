1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Pan is my rocket ship, taking me high

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Into the stars, I’ll soar and fly

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
10... 9... feel the bass kick in

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Escape velocity, the journey begins

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Pan is my rocket ship, into the sky

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Lifting my soul as the notes rise high

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I hopped into my rocket, We're off to space

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
My smile’s so bright, like stars across my face

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The pans are lined up, ready to go

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Off to a planet, nobody else knows

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When I land, it's something new

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Every step, a melody comes through

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A Pan planet under my feet,

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Every step making sounds so sweet

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Pan is my rocket ship, taking me high

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Into the stars, I’ll soar and fly

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
10... 9... feel the bass kick in

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Escape velocity, the journey begins

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Pan is my rocket ship, into the sky

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Lifting my soul as the notes rise high

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As I journey onward, the ground beneath me sings

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Footsteps spark a chorus, like the buzz of wings

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Melodies envelop me, sweet as honey's gold

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Echoes of "Bees' Melody" in stories untold

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Pan is my rocket ship, taking me high

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
10... 9... feel the bass kick in

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Escape velocity, the journey begins

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Pan is my rocket ship, into the sky

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Lifting my soul as the notes rise high

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now I'm back, learning to play

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In Exodus band, day by day

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The Pan I play, the sound so sweet

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Feels like space under my feet

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Pan is my rocket ship, taking me high

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Lifting my soul as the notes rise high
